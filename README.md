# Pima-diabetes-Prediction-
Using the medical data of American Indian people living chiefly along the Gila and Salt Rivers in Arizona and in northern Mexico, this project is able to predict wheather a patient is a victim of diabetes or not. This project is inspired from a course. All different procedures which were tried before getting to the final conclusion are also included. Feel free to contribute and increase the acccuracy.
